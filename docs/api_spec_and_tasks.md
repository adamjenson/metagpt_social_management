    ("models.py", "Contains the models for User, Event, Activity, Recommendation, and Notification"),
    ("views.py", "Contains the views for handling API requests"),
    ("urls.py", "Contains the URL patterns for routing API requests"),
    ("serializers.py", "Contains the serializers for User and Event models"),
    ("recommendation.py", "Contains the logic for generating recommendations"),

]
```

## Task list:
```python
[
    "main.py",
    "models.py",
    "serializers.py",
    "views.py",

]
```

## Shared Knowledge:
```python
"""
The 'main.py' file contains the main entry point of the application. It should be used to start the Django server.

The 'models.py' file contains the models for User, Event, Activity, Recommendation, and Notification. These models define the structure of the database tables.

The 'serializers.py' file contains the serializers for User and Event models. Serializers are used to convert model instances to JSON format and vice versa.

The 'views.py' file contains the views for handling API requests. Views define the logic for processing requests and returning responses.

The 'urls.py' file contains the URL patterns for routing API requests. It maps URLs to specific views.

The 'recommendation.py' file contains the logic for generating recommendations. It uses machine learning algorithms and user preferences to suggest activities.

The 'messaging.py' file contains the logic for sending messages and notifications. It integrates with messaging platforms like Twilio or SendGrid.

The 'discovery.py' file contains the logic for discovering activities and events. It utilizes APIs from services like Meetup, Eventbrite, or Foursquare.

The 'notifications.py' file contains the logic for sending notifications. It uses push notification services like Firebase Cloud Messaging or OneSignal.

The 'templates/' directory is used to store HTML templates for rendering dynamic web pages.

The 'static/' directory is used to store static files like CSS stylesheets and JavaScript files.

The 'frontend/' directory is used to store frontend code, such as React components and styles.

The 'requirements.txt' file lists all the required Python packages and their versions.
