## Original Requirements:

The boss wants us to create a consumer app that manages someone's social life and provides recommendations for what to do.

## Product Goals:
```python
[
    "Create a consumer app that helps manage social life",
    "Provide personalized recommendations for activities",
    "Ensure efficient and user-friendly experience"
]
```

## User Stories:
```python
[
    "As a user, I want to be able to create and manage my social events",
    "As a user, I want the app to suggest activities based on my preferences and location",
    "As a user, I want to be able to invite and coordinate with my friends for social events",
    "As a user, I want to be able to discover new activities and events in my area",
    "As a user, I want the app to provide reminders and notifications for upcoming events"
]
```

## Competitive Analysis:
```python

    "Facebook Events: Allows users to create and manage social events, but lacks personalized recommendations",
    "Meetup: Provides recommendations for activities and events, but focuses more on group meetups",
    "Eventbrite: Offers a wide range of events and ticketing services, but lacks social management features",
    "Foursquare: Provides recommendations for places to visit, but does not focus on social events",
    "Time Out: Offers curated recommendations for activities and events, but lacks social management features",
    "Google Calendar: Allows users to manage events and provides reminders, but does not offer personalized recommendations",
    "Yelp: Provides recommendations for places to visit, but does not focus on social events"

```

## UI Design draft:
The app should have a clean and intuitive design with the following elements and functions:
- Home screen with personalized activity recommendations and upcoming events

- Event creation and management feature with options to set date, time, location, and invite friends
- Discover section to explore new activities and events in the user's area
